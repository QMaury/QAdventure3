A text based adventure game written in C.
Sequel to QAdventure2 (obviously)

# What?
In the finished QAdventure3 (working title), you will navigate thro-
ugh multi-level dungeons, battle fantasy creatures, finish quests 
for different characters and, above all, wrestle with the clunky, 
primitive UI.

In it's current state, this is barely a game. QAdventure3 right now 
is more like a loose few lines of code that resemble what could've 
passed for a game in the 1970's. I am working to get this game 
finished in at least a few months, though any release date would be
speculation.

You are still free to go ahead and compile the game, play it yourse-
lf, and marvel at my fantastic over-use of `if` statements.

If you do not like my code, I sympathize with you. I don't like my 
code either: so I implore you, send a pull request if you feel so 
inclined.
